# Tic-Tac-Toe-project
This is tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns. This project was suggested by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop) and is part of the [Microverse Curriculum](https://www.microverse.org/#world-class-curriculum).

# Rules of the Game
Tic Tac Toe is a strategy game. Your objective is to form a sequence in the 3 x 3 grid. The sequence can be a straight line, a column or a diagonal line made of three consecutive X's or O's. The first player to complete this objective is the winner! If both the players fill the grid without creating a sequence, it is considered a draw. Below there's examples of the winning cases and the draw.
